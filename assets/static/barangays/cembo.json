    "about": "<div>Cembo, a popular acronym for Central Enlisted Men’s Barrio, has its beginning in 1949, when the first batch of enlisted servicemen from the Infantry Group, Philippine Ground Force, Florida Blanca, Pampanga arrived at the Fort William McKinley (now Fort Bonifacio). They were directed to settle at big rolling open tract of land adjacent to the North Gate (Gate I) which was mostly covered by a dense growth of cogon grass. The place was selected to be the site for the housing area of the enlisted personnel of the Philippine Ground Force.</div> <div>As the bulk of the whole command came later, the housing area became congested. M/Sgt. Teofilo Bautista, the barrio Lieutenant and Assistant Reservation Officer, was directed by the higher headquarter offices to lead a survey team for the location of the unoccupied space in the vast sprawling reservation thus West Rembo was created. Subsequently, the other barrios were created like the East Rembo, Comembo, and Pembo to accommodate the increasing population of the military personnel.</div>",
