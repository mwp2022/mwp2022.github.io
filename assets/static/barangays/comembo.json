    "about": "The area now known as COMEMBO was formerly Mamancat.  Even before the coming of the Spanish colonizers, Mamancat was already a vibrant settlement teeming with various economic activities. As its names suggests, Mamancat – from Tagalog root word ancat – means import, a central place where good commodities were acquired, purchased or bartered. This activity complemented the role played by its more prosperous neighbor, Aguho (now Pateros) known also during the Spanish time as embarcadero or a place for embarkation.  It is an area where goods by foreign merchants coming from as far as India, China and the Middle East were brought and bartered for native goods and commodities.",
