Geographically, East Rembo is at the heart of three barrios namely: West Rembo, Comembo and Pembo. These settlements were named after the special units of the Armed Forces of the geographical location within or around the Fort.</div> <div>According to those who have been living in the barrio since its establishment, East Rembo is a self-sustaining community. The military administration of the Fort did not need to provide any assistance to the barrio. The families cooperated and coordinated to build the spirit of bayanihan in the community. The military administration of the barrio begun in 1956 and in the latter years when then, President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued Presidential Proclamation 2425 and was implemented in 1986 by then President Corazon C. Aquino granting land titles to its occupants. The barrios geographical-political boundary was turned-over to the civilian administration of the Municipality of Makati.</div>",
