    "about": "The more habitable part of Guadalupe near the Poblacion and the swamplands lie at the doorstep of the army camp. It was very practical for the maimed, sick, homeless and desperate war victims to settle in the swamps and hills and wilderness of Guadalupe. They were to start life anew, and they called their new haven, Guadalupe Nuevo. The people who settled in Guadalupe Nuevo were industrious, hardworking, enterprising, foresighted and ambitious. They were soldiers, farmers, fishermen, traders, masons, carpenters, small-time businessmen and a stray of teachers and government and private company employees.  Through their combined efforts, they were able to resurrect a derelict barrio into one of the progressive places in Makati. Today, Guadalupe Nuevo is peopled by professionals, big-time businessmen, industrialists, political and civic leaders, retired soldiers and employees.",
