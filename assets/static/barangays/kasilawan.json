    "about": "Kasilawan was once part of Tejeros. In 1960, a resolution was passed for its separation from the latter. It was finally approved by the Provincial Board of Rizal on January 29, of the same year. It got its name from the former Mayor Pablo C.Cortes, a well-known member of the free Masonry Lodge No. 77 better known as Kasilawan Lodge. It was also known as Suaboy because it was once swampy and pigs roamed around the place. Presently, our barangay is now well populated, nomore swampy areas, no more pigs roaming around the area. It has a number of business establishments such as BJS Compound that houses several offices and laboratories operating in the compound. High rise buildings were constructed and alot of new residential concrete buildings were built. There was a lot of improvementin the economic condition of the residents wherein almost 50% own vehicles.",
