    "about": "Magallanes is one of the earliest subdivisions established in Makati by the Ayala family. Magallanes was established and founded in 1965 (1960 by Mayor Maximo Estrella) even during the time when Makati was still part of the province of Rizal. First settlers of the Barangay were the affluent families from Singalong, Binondo, etc. and Ambassadors and Consuls of several Foreign Embassies. Residents of the Barangay are varied: businessmen, management employees, professionals (doctors,lawyers, architects, engineers, etc.), students and household staff. The community developed from a residential to a highly developed mixed economy which includes restaurants, groceries, business offices, schools, industrial and retail stores, utilities and shopping buildings and malls.",
