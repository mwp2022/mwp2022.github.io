    "about": "<div>Pembo used to be a military reservation of the elite Armed Forces of the Philippines cracked unit, the First Ranger Regiment code - named \"PANTHERS\". The word \"Pembo\" is an acronym for PHANTERS ENLISTED MEN''S BARRIO. Only military dependents were allowed to reside in Pembo. As the years passed by, the military personnel and their dependents grew by the number, as they built their homes and learned to love the place and improvised structures gradually multiplied. Camp authorities, however, ordered the demolition of some of these structures in the military reservation.</div> <div>In February 1996, City Ordinance No. 96-010, an Ordinance creating a new Barangay - Barangay Rizal out of Barangay Pembo, principally authored by Hon. Councilor Astolfo C. Pimentel and co - authored by Vice Mayor Arturo S. Yabut and all member of the Sangguniang Panglungsod ng Makati, was enacted and approved.</div>",
