    "about": "<div>Post-War Pinagkaisahan.  After the war, Ayala y Cia turned the southeastern part of its property into the present Manila Golf Club.  Later on, the southwest rice fields were graded and became the North Forbes Park.  The national government’s “Highway 54” was completed.  This highway was later renamed Epifanio de los Santos Avenue or EDSA.  All these developments found several original families dislocated/relocated to other places in the barrio.  These developments also defined the present boundaries of Pinagkaisahan.</div> <div>True to its given name, Pinagkaisahan started to modernize mainly due to the united, bayanihan spirit among the residents where everybody knew everybody by their first names.  Associations and groups were formed for education, sports and economic purposes.  Civic organizations interacted with political forces to improve the community.</div>",

    "mission": "Barangay Pinagkaisahan, in keeping up with the developments of the 21st century and our neighboring commercial and business districts, will prepare its human resources by ensuring that school children will stay in school and benefit from Makati’s free education program, and for our adults to take advantage of Makati’s free vocational-technical skills courses.  We will take advantage of our strategic location by assisting private property owners to maximize the use of their properties, and for existing businesses to grow, that taxes derived from their earnings will sustain our further growth and development.",
    "vision": "We envision a decent community to live in, our children are in school, our adults are gainfully employed, and the once blighted areas transformed into productive properties, generating income to property owners and taxes for the government.",
