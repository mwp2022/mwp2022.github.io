  "about": "<div>The Barangay was established in 1956 when the Commanding General of the Philippine Army saw the need to provide housing area at the periphery of Fort Bonifacio for Military personnel thus Pitogo was one of the Enlisted Men’s Barrio that was created. From then on, the influx of AFP families continued to settle one after the other until the whole area became full residential community. The affairs of the Barangay was then being administratively controlled by the Post Commander of Fort Bonifacio. The first election of barangay officials was held on May 17, 1982.</div> <div>Two (2) decades ago, Pitogo was branded as the “Little Tondo” of Fort Bonifacio where hoodlum and several notorious gang thrive. Now, it is a peaceful community and gained the honor being the Outstanding Barangay for the year 1991 – 1993.</div>",
