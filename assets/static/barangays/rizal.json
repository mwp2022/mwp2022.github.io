  "about": "Barangay Rizal used to be a panorama of chirping birds and flattering trees where farming activities thrived. Now, it is one of the highly developed barangays in the city of Makati. Its origin dated back to the height of the EDSA revolution. When Pres. Corazon C. Aquino rose to power in 1986, she repeatedly pronounced the distribution of land to the landless as a major policy of her government. Fired up by this procurement, people from different places in Metro Manila began occupying the land in the guise of people power. In this light, Mayor Jejomar C. Binay of the Municipality of Makati saw it proper to subdivide the land in Barangay Pembo and awarded the same to his landless and homeless constituents. Helped along by the technical expertise of Engr. Ernesto Mercado of the Medina Survey group, the distribution of lots was completed in the same year.",
