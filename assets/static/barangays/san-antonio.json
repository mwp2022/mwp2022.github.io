  "about": "There was once a story about the origin of San Antonio Village. The story goes that in 1952, a Roman Catholic Church was built in this place. It was called Pasong Tamo Church and had a traditional cemetery beside it. The officiating priest was one Father Fernandez who possessed great occult power that he was said to be able to say mass in his native Holland, only an hour or so after he said mass in Pasong Tamo Church in Camachile on Sunday mornings. He was also said to be keeping something which was originally of the Lord Christ himself. Somehow, the priest came to be known as no other than Saint Antonio De Padua. Because of his miraculous identity, the people of Camachile here were moved to decide as one to claim him as patron saint.",
