  "about": "<div>In early 1950’s, the Philippine Army established its permanent headquarters in Fort Bonifacio, formerly known as Fort McKinley. During the incumbency of the late Brig. General as Philippine Army Commanding General, He set aside a small portion of the sprawling military camp for the enlisted personnel’s temporary housing area. The place is located near Gate No.1 (North Gate) adjacent to Barangay Guadalupe Nuevo. The area was called then up to now as CENTRAL ENLISTED MEN’S BARRIO or CEMBO.</div> <div>Cembo proper then has an original five (5) districts. But, within a few years, the barrio had limited area for new occupants. Thus, the new occupants were given lots at the southern part of the Barangay proper or at the side of the creek. This led to the creation of another district- the 6th district or Cembo Annex, wherein, the incumbent Barangay Captain of Cembo proper was the late Lt. Alejandro Aquino.</div>",
